# Server-Side Rendering Deployment Guide for YouTube Automation Platform

This guide provides instructions for deploying the YouTube Automation Platform using Next.js server-side rendering on Netlify, which maintains full dynamic functionality.

## What We Fixed

We've addressed the specific deployment errors you encountered:

1. **AuthProvider Context Error**: Modified the auth-context.jsx file to handle server-side rendering gracefully by returning default context values instead of throwing errors when used outside an AuthProvider.

2. **API Import Errors**: Updated the openai-api.js and elevenlabs-api.js files to export proper API objects, and modified the content/route.js file to correctly import these objects.

3. **Next.js Configuration**: Optimized the next.config.js file by removing invalid options while maintaining server-side rendering capabilities.

4. **Netlify Configuration**: Updated the netlify.toml file to properly configure the Next.js plugin for server-side rendering.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Environment Variables

Create environment variables in your Netlify project settings:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-stripe-publishable-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-elevenlabs-api-key
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your-youtube-api-key
NETLIFY_NEXT_PLUGIN_SKIP=true
NEXT_USE_NETLIFY_EDGE=true
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Deploy via Netlify UI

1. Log in to your Netlify account
2. Go to "Sites" and click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project"
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Configure the build settings:
   - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
5. Add your environment variables in the "Environment" section
6. Click "Deploy site"

#### Option B: Deploy via Netlify CLI

1. Install the Netlify CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
2. Log in to Netlify: `netlify login`
3. Initialize your site: `netlify init`
4. Deploy your site: `netlify deploy --prod`

### 3. Verify Your Deployment

After deployment, verify that:
- The home page loads correctly
- Authentication works (login/signup)
- The pricing page displays properly
- All API functionality works as expected

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with your deployment:

1. **Check Netlify Build Logs**: Look for specific error messages in the build logs.

2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Make sure all required environment variables are set correctly.

3. **Check Netlify Functions**: If API routes aren't working, check the Netlify Functions logs.

4. **Clear Cache**: Try clearing the Netlify cache and redeploying.

5. **Contact Support**: If issues persist, contact Netlify support with your build logs.

# Module Import Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary

The YouTube Automation platform was encountering build failures during deployment to Netlify due to missing module imports. The specific error messages were:

```
Failed to compile.

./src/app/api/content/route.js
Module not found: Can't resolve './openai-api'

./src/app/api/content/route.js
Module not found: Can't resolve './elevenlabs-api'

./src/app/api/content/route.js
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../lib/trend-analyzer'

./src/app/api/content/route.js
Module not found: Can't resolve './s3-storage'

./src/app/api/scheduler/route.js
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../lib/youtube-api'
```

These errors occurred because the application was trying to import modules that didn't exist or had incorrect paths.

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Created Missing API Modules**:
   - Created `/src/app/api/openai-api.js` - OpenAI integration for content generation
   - Created `/src/app/api/elevenlabs-api.js` - ElevenLabs integration for text-to-speech
   - Created `/src/lib/trend-analyzer.js` - Trend analysis for viral content discovery
   - Created `/src/app/api/s3-storage.js` - AWS S3 integration for file storage

2. **Updated Import Statements**:
   - Modified `/src/app/api/content/route.js` to use the correct import patterns
   - Modified `/src/app/api/scheduler/route.js` to properly import from youtube-api.js

3. **Implemented Function Compatibility**:
   - Ensured all exported functions match the expected function signatures
   - Added proper error handling and build environment detection
   - Implemented mock data returns for build/SSG environments

## Technical Details

### OpenAI API Module
- Implemented content generation functions with proper error handling
- Added script generation with customizable parameters
- Created topic idea generation with trending analysis
- Implemented metadata generation for YouTube optimization

### ElevenLabs API Module
- Implemented text-to-speech conversion with voice selection
- Added voice listing functionality
- Created voiceover generation with script cleaning
- Implemented audio duration estimation

### Trend Analyzer Module
- Implemented trend analysis across multiple categories
- Added viral potential prediction with scoring
- Created category management
- Implemented mock data for development and testing

### S3 Storage Module
- Implemented file upload, download, and management
- Added signed URL generation for secure access
- Created storage usage tracking
- Implemented directory listing and organization

### Route File Updates
- Updated import statements to use the new modules
- Modified function calls to match the implemented signatures
- Improved error handling and response formatting
- Added build environment detection for SSG compatibility

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   Make sure all required environment variables are set in your Netlify deployment settings:
   ```
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   OPENAI_API_KEY
   STRIPE_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Push the updated code to your repository
   - Connect your repository to Netlify
   - Configure the build settings:
     - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `.next`

3. **Verify Build Success**:
   - Monitor the build logs to ensure all modules are properly resolved
   - Check for any new warnings or errors that might need addressing

## Future Considerations

1. **Module Organization**:
   - Consider moving all API integrations to a dedicated `/src/lib/api/` directory
   - Implement a consistent naming convention for all API modules

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement more robust error handling and logging
   - Add retry mechanisms for API calls

3. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for all API modules
   - Implement integration tests for the route handlers

4. **Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Add JSDoc comments to all functions

## Conclusion

The implemented fixes resolve all the module import errors that were causing build failures. The application now has proper implementations of all required API integrations with appropriate fallbacks for build environments. The code is now more maintainable and follows better organization practices.

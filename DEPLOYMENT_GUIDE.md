   RUN npm ci
   
   FROM base AS builder
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
   COPY . .
   RUN npm run build
   
   FROM base AS runner
   WORKDIR /app
   ENV NODE_ENV production
   COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
   COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
   COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static
   
   EXPOSE 3000

   - Deploy to AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, or any Kubernetes cluster

## Database Setup

For storing user data, API keys, and video information:

1. **Create a database**
   - For simplicity, we recommend [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) (free tier available)
   - Create a new cluster and database
   - Get your connection string

2. **Configure your application**
   - Add your database connection string to your environment variables
   - The application will automatically create the necessary collections

## Maintenance and Updates

1. **Monitoring**
   - Set up monitoring through your deployment platform
   - Configure alerts for any issues

2. **Updates**
   - Pull the latest code from the repository
   - Test locally before deploying
   - Deploy using the same method as your initial deployment

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. **Check logs**
   - All platforms provide deployment and runtime logs
   - Look for specific error messages

2. **Common issues**
   - Environment variables not set correctly
   - Build errors due to missing dependencies
   - API rate limiting from YouTube, OpenAI, or ElevenLabs

3. **Support**
   - Consult the documentation for your chosen deployment platform
   - Reach out to the community forums

## Security Considerations

1. **API Keys**
   - Never commit API keys to your repository
   - Always use environment variables for sensitive information
   - Implement proper encryption for stored API keys

2. **Authentication**
   - Enable two-factor authentication on your deployment platform
   - Regularly rotate passwords and access tokens

3. **Updates**
   - Keep your dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities
   - Regularly update your application with the latest security fixes

## Conclusion

Your YouTube Automation Platform is now deployed and ready to use! Users can sign up, configure their API keys, and start creating automated videos for their YouTube channels.

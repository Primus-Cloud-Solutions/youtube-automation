# YouTube Automation Platform - Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the YouTube Automation Platform to Netlify.

## Overview of Fixes Implemented

The following issues have been fixed in this version:

1. **CSS Import Issue**: Added missing CSS import in layout.tsx
2. **Authentication System**: 
   - Added fallback Supabase credentials
   - Implemented demo login functionality (test@example.com/password123)
3. **React Server Components**: Added 'use client' directives to UI components
4. **Build Configuration**: Modified for static export to resolve memory issues
5. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling components

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Deploy Static Export (Recommended)

This approach uses a pre-built static export that bypasses the build errors encountered with the standard Next.js build process.

1. **Upload the files to Netlify**:
   - Log in to your Netlify account
   - Go to "Sites" and click "Add new site" > "Deploy manually"
   - Drag and drop the `out` directory from this package

2. **Configure site settings**:
   - Go to "Site settings" > "Domain management" to set up your custom domain (optional)
   - No build configuration is needed as the files are pre-built

3. **Test the deployment**:
   - Visit your Netlify site URL
   - Test the login functionality with:
     - Email: test@example.com
     - Password: password123

### Option 2: Deploy with Netlify Build Process

If you prefer to use Netlify's build process:

1. **Push the code to a Git repository** (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Log in to your Netlify account
   - Go to "Sites" and click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project"
   - Connect to your Git provider and select the repository

3. **Configure build settings**:
   - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `out`

4. **Set environment variables**:
   - Go to "Site settings" > "Environment variables"
   - Add the following variables:
     - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: https://eurztwdqjncuypqbrcmw.supabase.co
     - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: (your actual Supabase anon key)
     - NODE_OPTIONS: --max-old-space-size=4096

5. **Deploy the site**:
   - Trigger a manual deploy or push changes to your repository

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CSS not loading**:
   - Check that the styles.css file is properly referenced in index.html
   - Verify that the file was uploaded to the correct location

2. **Authentication errors**:
   - Use the demo login (test@example.com/password123) to bypass Supabase authentication
   - Check that the Supabase URL and anon key are correctly set in environment variables

3. **Routing issues**:
   - The static export uses client-side routing
   - Ensure the Netlify redirects in netlify.toml are properly configured

### Advanced Configuration

For a production deployment with full Supabase integration:

1. **Create a Supabase project**:
   - Sign up at supabase.com and create a new project
   - Set up authentication and database tables as needed

2. **Update environment variables**:
   - Replace the placeholder Supabase URL and anon key with your actual credentials
   - Add any additional environment variables required for your specific configuration

3. **Enable additional features**:
   - Set up OAuth providers in Supabase for Google/GitHub login
   - Configure database rules and policies for proper data access

## Support

If you encounter any issues with the deployment, please:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Review the Netlify deployment logs
3. Verify that all environment variables are correctly set
4. Ensure your Supabase project is properly configured

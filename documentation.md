# YouTube Automation Project - Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the fixes and enhancements implemented in the YouTube Automation project. Due to connectivity limitations in the sandbox environment preventing direct browser testing, this documentation serves as a detailed guide to the changes made and how they address the original issues.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Context Enhancement
- **Issue**: The authentication context was not properly handling server-side rendering and lacked subscription information.
- **Fix**: 
  - Enhanced `auth-context.jsx` to properly handle server-side rendering
  - Added subscription information with default values
  - Made the `useAuth` hook more resilient during build process
  - Fixed import paths in dashboard pages to correctly reference the auth context

### 2. Path Resolution Problems
- **Issue**: Import paths were causing "Module not found" errors during build.
- **Fix**:
  - Updated Next.js configuration to properly handle path aliases
  - Fixed import paths in dashboard pages to use the correct alias-based paths
  - Updated TypeScript configuration to support path aliases
  - Ensured consistent use of absolute imports with the @ alias

### 3. S3 Storage Integration
- **Issue**: S3 storage functions were implemented but not fully connected to video storage.
- **Fix**:
  - Enhanced S3 storage integration with proper file management
  - Added automatic cleanup of S3 files after YouTube upload
  - Improved storage usage tracking based on subscription limits
  - Connected S3 storage to video processing workflow

### 4. Payment Service Subscription Display
- **Issue**: The dashboard was showing hardcoded subscription information instead of the user's actual subscription plan.
- **Fix**:
  - Updated dashboard to show actual subscription plan from auth context
  - Connected payment service to user subscription data
  - Added dynamic content based on subscription limits
  - Enhanced subscription state management in auth context

### 5. Content Scheduling Enhancement
- **Issue**: Content scheduling features were limited and not subscription-aware.
- **Fix**:
  - Updated manual-topics and topic-scheduler pages
  - Added trend analysis and monetization scoring
  - Improved category selection options
  - Made scheduling features subscription-aware

## Build Process Verification
The application now builds successfully without errors. The build process completes with only minor warnings about optional dependencies, which is acceptable for development.

## Deployment Instructions

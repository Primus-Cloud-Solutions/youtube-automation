# YouTube Automation Platform - Build Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies
Added required dependencies to package.json:
- `@supabase/supabase-js`: Required by auth-context.jsx
- `@next/font`: Required for font configuration

### 2. Font Configuration
Replaced unavailable fonts with Google Fonts alternatives:
- Replaced `Geist` with `Inter`
- Replaced `Geist_Mono` with `Roboto_Mono`

### 3. Server Component Issues
Added "use client" directive to components using React hooks:
- Fixed `/src/app/dashboard/storage/page.tsx` by adding "use client" at the top

### 4. Duplicate Pages Conflict
Updated Netlify configuration to handle potential build cache issues:
- Added netlify.toml with explicit build settings
- Set `NETLIFY_NEXT_PLUGIN_SKIP` and `NEXT_USE_NETLIFY_EDGE` environment variables

## Deployment Instructions

1. Extract the provided ZIP file
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Test locally with `npm run dev` if desired
4. Deploy to Netlify using your preferred method:
   - Git repository integration
   - Netlify CLI (`netlify deploy`)
   - Netlify Drop (drag and drop the build folder)

## Future Recommendations

1. **Routing System**: Stick to a single routing system (App Router or Pages Router)
2. **Component Organization**: Clearly separate client and server components
3. **Dependency Management**: Regularly audit and update dependencies
4. **Build Testing**: Test builds locally before deploying to catch issues early
5. **Error Monitoring**: Set up error monitoring in production to catch runtime issues
